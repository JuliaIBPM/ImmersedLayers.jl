# Grid operations

```@meta
CurrentModule = ImmersedLayers
```

## Basic differential operations
There are a variety of (purely) grid-based operators that are useful for carrying
out calculations in immersed layer problems. We will demonstrate a few of them
here.
We will start by generating the cache, just as we did in [Immersed layer caches](@ref)

````@example gridops
using ImmersedLayers
using CartesianGrids
using Plots
````

### Set up a grid and cache

````@example gridops
Δx = 0.01
Lx = 4.0
xlim = (-Lx/2,Lx/2)
ylim = (-Lx/2,Lx/2)
g = PhysicalGrid(xlim,ylim,Δx)
````

We still generate a cache for these operations, but
now, we only supply the grid. There are no immersed surfaces
for this demonstration.

````@example gridops
cache = SurfaceScalarCache(g,scaling=GridScaling)
````

To demonstrate, let's generate a Gaussian

````@example gridops
p = zeros_grid(cache)
xg, yg = x_grid(cache), y_grid(cache)
p .= exp.(-(xg∘xg)-(yg∘yg))
````

Now, let's generate the gradient of these data

````@example gridops
v = zeros_gridgrad(cache)
grad!(v,p,cache)
plot(v,cache)
````

We can then compute the derivative of this data

````@example gridops
divv = zeros_grid(cache)
divergence!(divv,v,cache)
plot(divv,cache)
````

## Convective derivatives
And finally, let's compute convective derivatives. First, we will compute

$$\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla p$$

For this operation, we create a special additional cache using [`ConvectiveDerivativeCache`](@ref).
This extra cache holds additional memory for making the calculation of the convective derivative faster
if we compute it often.

````@example gridops
cdcache = ConvectiveDerivativeCache(cache)
vdp = zeros_grid(cache)
convective_derivative!(vdp,v,p,cache,cdcache) #hide
@time convective_derivative!(vdp,v,p,cache,cdcache)
nothing #hide
````

Plot it

````@example gridops
plot(vdp,cache)
````

Now, let's compute

$$\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{v}$$

For this, we create a cache for `VectorGridData`, and a new instance of
`ConvectiveDerivativeCache` to go along with it.

````@example gridops
vcache = SurfaceVectorCache(g,scaling=GridScaling)
vdv = zeros_grid(vcache)
cdvcache = ConvectiveDerivativeCache(vcache)
convective_derivative!(vdv,v,vcache,cdvcache) #hide
@time convective_derivative!(vdv,v,vcache,cdvcache)
nothing #hide
````

Plot it

````@example gridops
plot(vdv,vcache)
````

Finally, let's compute

$$(\curl\mathbf{v})\times\mathbf{v}$$

For this, we create a cache called
`RotConvectiveDerivativeCache` to go along with it.

````@example gridops
w = zeros_gridcurl(vcache)
curl!(w,v,vcache)
wv = zeros_grid(vcache)
cdrcache = RotConvectiveDerivativeCache(vcache)
w_cross_v!(wv,w,v,vcache,cdrcache) #hide
@time w_cross_v!(wv,w,v,vcache,cdrcache)
````

Plot it

````@example gridops
plot(wv,vcache)
````
